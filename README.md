# open-education

The high-level goal of this project is to reduce education inequity, in Hong Kong (at first!). 

The specific goal this repo is trying to achieve has the following steps:

1. A rewarding learning environment by stimulating in-class and out-class in a maths game context
2. A video engine that allows teachers to create simplistic yet elegant teaching materials (3blue1brown)
3. Crowd-sourced teaching materials recommender system for students

I will join Teach For Hong Kong next year to experiment with step 1, and start to build connection/first-hand experiences for step 2 and step 3. 

Please contact me via alexfungshunhang@gmail.com if you would like to work with me to tackle this social issue.
